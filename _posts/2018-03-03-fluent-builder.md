# Point out to Fluent Builder

This week I had occasion participated in training organised by company which I provide my services.
The main goal of training was improve our knowlege about design patterns, and all other stuff that we can call a good practices.

Our exercises relied on analyzing fragments of code (that was not really pretty), next on trying to pick up suitable pattern and finally on refactoring those fragments with chosen pattern.

When we stopped at the exercise with builder pattern, one thing motivated me to make this post.
Just for quick reminder I put here qoute from the gang of four book that describe the purpose of builder pattern.

>Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

To be honest I had only two occasions to implement and use fluent builder pattern, below I present how it could looks like.

Lets imagine that **RecruitmentApplication** is some kind of large contract exhibited by an external service belonging to some university. As we can see it could be really large flat strucutre contract that's inlcude every information which is gonna be need during recruitment process to university.

 We can use fluent builder pattern here to simplify creation of objects like RecruitmentApplication.

But back to my training, in many posts about fluent builder I noticed that object returned from builder was initialized in Builder constructor like that:

```csharp
public ApplicationBuilder CreateApplication(string name, string sureName, DateTime birthDate)
{
    var application = new RecruitmentApplication();
    application.Name = name;
    application.SureName = sureName;
    application.BirthDate = birthDate;

    return this;
}
```

I also initialized object like that in my implementations of Builder pattern. I've thought it was good approach, create object in construcor, fill it using fluent manner and return after calling **Build** method. But during training my instructor after reviewing my example gave me valuable attention. What if I would like to run **Build** method several time ?

```csharp
var builder = new ApplicationBuilder();
var application = builder
    .CreateApplication("Zaba", "Zul", new DateTime(1990, 9, 2))
    .WithDormitoryAssignment("Filon", "Kilinskiego 11")
    .WithRepetition("Electronics", 10, 10, 550)
    .WithRepetition("Object Oriented Programming", 20, 15, 850)
    .Build();
var secondApplication = builder.Build();
var thirdApplication = builder.Build();
```

In above example each time builder returns reference to exactly the same object. And that's not correct. Builder should return new object every time we call **Build** method.
So how can it be implemented correctly ? I can move object initialized to **Build** method and create right amount of private fields for storing values from fluent methods.
I realize that's increase amount of code lines, but with this manner I'm sure that my builder gives me a brand new object. Nice!
Of course below you can find how it could looks like after a small refactoring.
